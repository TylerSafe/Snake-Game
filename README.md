# Snake-Game
Classic snake game with a boundary around the boarder, working progress creating 2 player mode

Description:

Classic snake game with a boundary around the boarder, scoring based on apples consumed and increasing length with consumption. The game ends when you collide with the boundary or your own body. I still have plans to implement a 2 player option where people can compete with eachother although that is still a working progress.
